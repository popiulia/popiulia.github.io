  <h1> About </h1>
  <span> </span>


  <p>  Ambitious professional hard working person, going through a career change, looking for work that would challenge my perspective, new skills, help me improve, create qualitative solutions as well as provide customer satisfaction.
After following my passion and becoming a physical therapist, I realized after 4 years that this does not grant me enough professional satisfaction and that my career needs a bit more for me to be truly fulfilled. While helping people and helping them take care of themselves is still a top priority for me, I decided to go through a career transformation and went through an intensive, challenging and, thought-provoking 1 year school with Career Foundry, to learn the secrets of User Experience Design & Front-End Development.
As Plato used to say, "I know that I know nothing", while studying I understood there is still a lot to learn ahead, but I am enthusiastically looking forward to that, for the challenge, for the troubleshooting and searching for the best design.
My experience as a therapist helped me understand people, be able to relate, communicate, and work with them towards a common goal. I worked both on my own as well as in a clinic, so I am a team player and like to work with others, as well as coach them and maintain a growth-based environment for a solid, mutual development.
I am actively looking for either employment in a role that would allow me to practice my newly-developed skills and help me develop new ones or individual projects that I would deliver on my own. </p>
